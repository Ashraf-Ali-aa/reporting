## Dashboards

  General is the main page that will be displayed by default when you open Zebrunner.
By default, it accumulates 4 widgets - 30 days total, 30 days pass rate by platform, 30 days test details, and 30 days tests trend.
Later on, all the other added widgets would also be displayed there:
