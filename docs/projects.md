## Projects


The “Projects” service is used for switching between the projects and sub-projects the user works on.
Once you’ve switched to the necessary project, all the data in Dashboards and Widgets will be displayed accordingly.

To open the menu, navigate to the lower-left corner of the window to the icon of the project (available from all the pages):
